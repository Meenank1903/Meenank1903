        <p class="card-text">
          Solid waste management is a major problem for many urban local bodies in India, 
          where urbanization, industrialization, and economic growth have resulted in increased municipal solid waste generation per person. 
          Effective SWM is a major challenge in cities with high population density. 
          Achieving sustainable development within a country experiencing rapid population growth and 
          improvements in living standards is made more difficult in India because it is a diverse country with many different religious groups, cultures, and traditions

          The most significant advantage of adopting bioremediation technologies is the positive impact on the environment.
Nature itself is used to fix nature in this process.
Microbes that can degrade the pollutant multiply and produce harmless byproducts, unlike other waste removal techniques.
The treatment's leftovers are often innocuous compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, and cell biomass.
